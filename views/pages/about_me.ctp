<?php $this->set('title_for_layout', 'About Me')?>
<p>My name is Dick Blosser and I live in Fullerton California.  My personal web site is at <a href="http://www.dickblosser.com">www.DickBlosser.com</a>.  About twenty years ago while teaching Aircraft and Powerplant Mechanics at Mt San Antonio College one of my fellow teachers told me about one of his night studentâ€™s project.  It was a 1943 Stinson L-5.  The student had purchased the aircraft that had been in parts for as number of years and had started to restore it.  He had overhauled the Lycoming O-435 engine and rebuilt the wings during the school night program but doto problems had not finished the restoration.  In 1989, I purchased the unfinished project from him and with the help of a friend took a year and a half and completed the restoration.  Due to medical problems, I recently donated the L-5 to the aircraft museum at Santa Maria, California. During the last 20 years I have accumulated a large quantity of L-5 & O-435 and other aircraft parts.  I developed this web site in order to provide a place to relocate some of these items.  Hope you can fine something you need and we can find it a home.</p>
